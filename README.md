## Examples
You can do many things with Markdown. I have prepared some examples for you here. And I will show you how to use it in a `code section`.

### Formated text
There are some ways to format text.

This is a **fat text** and this is an *italic text* and finally ***you can mixed it***. 

A bold text you can write with: `**fat text**`  
An italic text you can write with: `*italic text*`  
A bold italic text you can write with: `***mix it***`

### Lists
There are three types of lists.

This is an unordered list:
- list item 1
- list item 2
- list item 3
- list item 4

And this is an ordered list:
1. item
2. item
3. item
4. item

And this is a mixed list:
- item 1
- item 2
  1. item
  2. item
  3. item
- item 3

An unordered list you can write with: `- item 1` and so long  
An ordered list you can write with: `1. item` and so long  
An mixed list you can write with:  
`- item 1`  
`  1. item`  
and so long

Finally you can get a horizontal line by using: `---`
